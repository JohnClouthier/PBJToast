         <h2 id="res">REASONING AND PHILOSOPHY</h2>
         <p>What defines peanut butter and jelly toast apart from its predecessor
         the peanut butter and jelly sandwich is the absence of the topping slice of bread.
         This absence in constructions of the toast is meant
         to address the many issues individuals have about the sandwich. 
         Such as the overpowering flavor and texture of bread,
         but also the issue of messiness when consuming an overfilled sandwich.
         A key issue the single toast method addresses is the crust of the sandwich.
         The crust of a sandwich makes up roughly 20% of a sandwich.
         If the crust is left without perfectly portioned
         or spread filling it will be unflavored and unpreferable to the remaining 60% that contains filling.
         This unattractiveness causes many younger kids
         to avoid or discard of the crust out of habit from experiencing too many unsatisfying sandwiches.
         Only eating one slice of toast makes it much more difficult to avoid eating the crust,
         and this method can be used to break such habits in older children. 
         The spoon spread method also addresses the issue of the undesirable heel of the loaf of bread 
         as it provides equal coverage of topping and balances flavors.
         The key feature of the peanut butter and jelly toast is the toasted component of the bread.
         By having the toast be enjoyable it increases the satisfaction of eating dish. 
         Letting a slice of bread caramelize under heat brings out the flavor of the bread
         and aids in providing an additional crunchy texture to the dish.
